description: <b>Task</b> After or during the implementation of a project, the added value and the potential are often important key figures in order to continue to demonstrate to stakeholders the value of the investment made. In order to create transparency accordingly, a KPI dashboard was to be developed. </br> <b>Challenge</b> The previous solution was an Excel-based dashboard, which meant that several versions were circulated by e-mail and no transparency could be created. </br> <b>Solution</b> By creating a PowerBI dashboard with a connection to a database, a daily status could be mapped automatically and made available centrally. Using Azure Active Directory, the permissions could be assigned so that each stakeholder has the appropriate read and/or write permissions. </br> <b>Tip</b> If you develop a dashboard and share it with people in a decentralized way, give a short introduction to their requirements and possibilities (e.g. filtering) and the calculation as well as possible assumptions of the displayed KPIs. This promotes a common understanding of the chart!
