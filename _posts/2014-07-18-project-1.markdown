description: Task: In everyday life it occurs again and again that database dumps are delivered as CSV files. </br> Problem: It is frequently noticed that the quality of the data is insufficient, resulting in time-consuming and manual data cleansing.</br> Solution: An on-prem application was developed that uses python as a rule engine for data quality checks and Excel as an input and output tool. An Excel template is used as input, which is filled and parameterized with rules to be validated. The execution of the rule engine then loads the defined rules, executes them on the data in the CSV file and generates an Excel file as output. In the Excel file, cells that do not match the defined rules are marked and a comment of the specific rule violation is added.</br> Learning: Providing rules with the possibility of parameterization so that users have maximum flexibility to perform all quality checks in an automated way.
